# Session Context - HRV Data Processing Implementation

## Summary
This session focused on implementing comprehensive HRV (Heart Rate Variability) data extraction and processing improvements across the biometric data pipeline. While HRV data extraction was successfully implemented in the biometric service, the analytics service integration remains incomplete.

## Background Context
This session continued from a previous conversation that had already implemented:
- Steps data visualization with partial data indicators (orange dashed borders, diagonal stripes)
- Heart rate chart fixes (filtering to resting HR only, absolute Y-axis 1-100 BPM)
- Sleep data extraction from nested Garmin API objects
- Manual data fetch functionality via database triggers
- Various dashboard improvements and metrics labeling

## Primary Issue Addressed
User reported: "Analytics Insights Tab → "Health Metrics" "Average HRV" still shows "No data"" despite successful HRV extraction in the biometric service.

## Key Technical Investigation
1. **HRV Data Extraction Status**: Confirmed biometric service successfully extracts HRV data
   - 98 rows of HRV data stored vs previous 9 rows of timestamps
   - Extraction logs show: "Extracted HRV summary field weeklyAvg: 49 from hrvSummary"
   - Sample data: `{"weeklyAvg": 46}`, `{"lastNightAvg": 38}`

2. **Analytics Service Issue**: Analytics service wasn't processing new HRV field structure
   - Only processed legacy `avgHRV` and `value` fields
   - Needed updates for `weeklyAvg`, `lastNightAvg`, `lastNight5MinHigh`, `lastNight5MinLow`, `hrvValue`

## Files Modified

### biometric_data_service.py
- **Lines 401-448**: Added HRV summary extraction from `hrvSummary` nested objects
- **Lines 426-446**: Added individual HRV readings extraction from `hrvReadings` array
- **Key Enhancement**: Extracts specific HRV fields (`weeklyAvg`, `lastNightAvg`, etc.) with proper logging

### biometric_data_analytics.py  
- **Lines 376-443**: Completely refactored HRV processing logic
- **Key Improvement**: Separates different HRV metric types instead of incorrectly averaging them together
- **Prioritization Logic**: Uses `lastNightAvg` as primary metric, falls back to `weeklyAvg`, then individual readings, then legacy data
- **Separate Metrics**: Stores `hrv_weekly_avg`, `hrv_last_night_avg`, `hrv_5min_high`, `hrv_5min_low`, `hrv_readings_avg` independently

### dashboard.py
- **Lines 243-268**: Added HRV data processing in `process_biometric_data()`
- **Lines 527-534**: Added filtering to remove useless HRV metrics (timestamps, IDs) from Detailed Metrics dropdown

## Data Verification
- **TimescaleDB**: Confirmed HRV summary data exists with 7 entries each for `hrv.weeklyAvg` and `hrv.lastNightAvg`
- **Sample Values**: `weeklyAvg: 46`, `lastNightAvg: 38` successfully extracted
- **Data Types**: All 14 data types present including HRV for user 1

## Current Status
**INCOMPLETE**: Despite successful implementation, HRV metrics still don't appear in Analytics Insights tab.

### Issues Remaining
1. **Analytics Processing**: Analytics service processes data but only outputs `avg_steps` in final metrics
2. **Daily Metrics Calculation**: HRV data not making it through to daily_metrics aggregation
3. **Container Updates**: Multiple rebuilds of analytics_service performed but issue persists

### Debugging Performed
- Verified HRV data exists in TimescaleDB: ✅
- Updated analytics processing logic: ✅  
- Rebuilt and restarted analytics_service: ✅
- Triggered manual analytics jobs (104-107): ✅
- Checked detailed_metrics table: ❌ (No HRV metrics stored)
- Verified analytics retrieves 20605 rows for week timeframe: ✅
- Confirmed 14 data types retrieved including HRV: ✅

## Technical Architecture
- **Biometric Service**: Fetches from Garmin API → TimescaleDB storage
- **Analytics Service**: Reads TimescaleDB → processes → PostgreSQL analytics results  
- **Dashboard**: Reads both TimescaleDB (detailed) and PostgreSQL (analytics) for display
- **Manual Triggers**: Dashboard → fetch_triggers table → biometric service polling

## Next Steps Needed
1. **Debug Analytics Daily Metrics**: Investigate why HRV data isn't making it through `_calculate_daily_metrics()`
2. **Add Debug Logging**: Insert temporary logging in analytics service to trace HRV data flow
3. **Verify Data Organization**: Check if user_data structure contains HRV data correctly organized by date
4. **Test Individual Functions**: Isolated testing of HRV processing logic in analytics service

## User Feedback
- User expressed frustration with incomplete implementation
- Session ended with user giving up due to persistent "No data" display in Analytics Insights
- Required clean git commit without referring to AI assistance

## Environment
- Docker-compose setup with TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, analytics_service, biometric_service, streamlit
- Services rebuilt multiple times during debugging
- All containers operational and processing data successfully except final HRV analytics display
